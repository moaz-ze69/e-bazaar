            Project: E-Commerce App: e-bazaar 

=========== ==================================== ===========

Here are two folders, "With Backend Connected" and "Without Backend Connected"

Both folders are having same project upto different working points. If you want
to run any of them, just follow instructions given in "Readme.txt" file in that folder.

     Here is some little explaination on both projects

o Without Backend Connected

  In this project, application is working perfectly fine. No backend is connected.
  All data is loaded locally on run time. Not a perferrable approach but this was done for testing
  purposes of the application.

o With Backend Connected

  In this project, backend is connected with application and all data is there, loaded up with a request
  from database when user navigates to that specific screen. Strapi is used as backend.
